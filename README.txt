Twist â€” Complete Final Package (One-page site + prototype + assets)
Files included at repo root:
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js
- README.txt
- twist_onboarding_one_page.pdf

Assets folder (assets/):
- logo_icon.svg
- logo_full.svg
- mockup_phone_placeholder.svg
- vector_profile.svg
- vector_chat.svg
- vector_group.svg
- chrome_neon_bg1.png
- chrome_neon_bg2.png

How to use:
1) Unzip package. You'll have index.html at the root and an 'assets' folder.
2) Open index.html locally to preview.
3) To deploy to GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify: create a GitHub repo and upload all files (index.html must be at repo root). Then connect the repo to Vercel or use Netlify Drop.

Notes:
- Images included are SVG placeholders and small PNG placeholders. If you want hi-res illustrations, I can replace them with fully-detailed vector artwork.
- The beta form is client-side only (no backend). I can integrate Google Forms / Mailchimp / Airtable later.
- All language is coded and avoids explicit illegal content.
